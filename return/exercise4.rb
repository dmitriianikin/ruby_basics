Dinner
Breakfast

puts "Dinner" was the line above the return/last value in the method, which means it still gets executed.
When we call the method it returns the last value, which in this case is "Breakfast".

  With that being said, the value of puts "Dinner" is nil, but the return value of meal is "Breakfast".
